# Data

For this analysis we'll use the [data set of EVs that are currently registered through The State of Washington.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usamabuttar/electric-vehicle-population-data-washington-us)

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
electric_vehicle_population <-read_csv("Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv")

```

Use glimpse() to view the variable names which are followed by abbreviations of the type of each variable such as \<chr\> for character (aka strings) and \<dbl\> is short for double (aka real numbers). Also, it shows the number of observations 121,978 and variables 17.

```{r}

glimpse(electric_vehicle_population)


```
